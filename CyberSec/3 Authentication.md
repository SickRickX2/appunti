### Authentication via Barcodes
Boarding passes, which are created at flight check-in and scanned before boarding.
In most applications, however, barcodes provide convenience but not security.
- Since barcodes are simply images, they are extremely easy to duplicate
### Magnetic Stripe Cards
Plastic card with a magnetic stripe containing personalized information about the card holder.
- The first track of a magnetic stripe card contains the cardholder's full name in addition to an account number, format information, and other data.
- The second track may contain the account number, expiration date, information about the issuing bank, data specifying the exact format of the track, and other discretionary data

>[!tip] Security
>One vulnerability of the magnetic stripe medium is that it is easy to read and reproduce.
>Magnetic stripe readers can be purchased at relatively low cost, allowing attackers to read information off cards. When couples with a magnetic stripe writer, which is only a little more expensive, an attacker can easily clone existing cards. so many uses require card holders to enter a PIN to use their cards.

### Smart tokens
Physical charateristics:
- include an embedded microprocessor
- a smart token that looks like a bank card
User interface:
- Manual interfaces include a keypad and display for human/token interaction
- Electronic interface
A smart card or other token requires an electronic interface to communicate with a compatible reader/writer.
- contact and contactless interfaces
Authentication protocol:
- classified into three categories:
	- static
	- dynamic password generator
	- challenge-response
### Smart Cards
Most important category of smart token 
- has the appearance of a credit card
- has an electronic interface
- may use any of the smart token protocols
Contain an entire microprocessor with 
- processor 
- memory
- I/O ports
Typically include three types of memory:
- Read-only memory (ROM)
	- stores data that does not change during the card's life
- Electrically erasable programmable ROM (EEPROM)
	- hold application data and programs
- Random access memory (RAM)
	- holds temporary data generated when applications are executed
