### Authentication via Barcodes
Boarding passes, which are created at flight check-in and scanned before boarding.
In most applications, however, barcodes provide convenience but not security.
- Since barcodes are simply images, they are extremely easy to duplicate
### Magnetic Stripe Cards
Plastic card with a magnetic stripe containing personalized information about the card holder.
- The first track of a magnetic stripe card contains the cardholder's full name in addition to an account number, format information, and other data.
- The second track may contain the account number, expiration date, information about the issuing bank, data specifying the exact format of the track, and other discretionary data

>[!tip] Security
>One vulnerability of the magnetic stripe medium is that it is easy to read and reproduce.
>Magnetic stripe readers can be purchased at relatively low cost, allowing attackers to read information off cards. When couples with a magnetic stripe writer, which is only a little more expensive, an attacker can easily clone existing cards. so many uses require card holders to enter a PIN to use their cards.

### Smart tokens
Physical charateristics:
- include an embedded microprocessor
- a smart token that looks like a bank card
User interface:
- Manual interfaces include a keypad and display for human/token interaction
- Electronic interface
A smart card or other token requires an electronic interface to communicate with a compatible reader/writer.
- contact and contactless interfaces
