## Symmetric Encryption
The universal technique for providing confidentiality for transmitted or stored data. It s also known as *conventional encryption* or *single key encryption*.
Two requirements for secure use:
- need a **strong** encryption **algorithm**
- sender and receiver must have obtained copies of the secret key in a secure fashion and must keep the key **secure**
