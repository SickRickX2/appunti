confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the
victim’s data, applications, or operating system or
otherwise annoying or disrupting the victim.”
### Classification of Malware
**Classified into two broad categories:**
Based first on how it spreads or propagates to reach the desired targets.
Then on the actions or payloads it performs once a target is reached.

**Also classified by:**
Those that need a host program (parasitic code such as viruses).
Those that are independent, self-contained programs (worms, trojans, and bots).
Malware that does not replicate (trojans and spam e-mail).
Malware that does replicate (viruses and worms).
### Types of Malicious Software (Malware)

*Propagation mechanisms include:*

- Infection of existing content by viruses that is subsequently spread to other systems.
- Exploit of software vulnerabilities by worms or drive-by-downloads to allow the malware to replicate
- Social engineering attacks that convince users to bypass security mechanisms to install. Trojans or to respond to phishing attacks.

*Payload actions performed by malware once it reaches a target system can include:*
- Corruption of system or data files
- Theft of service/make the system a zombie agent of attack as part of a botnet
- Theft of information from the system/keylogging
- Stealthing/hiding its presence on the system

### Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)

Well-resourced, persistent application of a wide variety of intrusion technologies and
malware to selected targets (usually business or political)
-  Typically attributed to state-sponsored organizations and criminal enterprises
- Differ from other types of attack by their careful target selection and stealthy intrusion efforts over extended periods
- High profile attacks include Aurora, RSA, APT1, and Stuxnet
