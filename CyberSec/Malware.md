>“A program that is inserted into a system, usually
covertly, with the intent of compromising the
confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the
victim’s data, applications, or operating system or
otherwise annoying or disrupting the victim.”
### Classification of Malware
**Classified into two broad categories:**
Based first on how it spreads or propagates to reach the desired targets.
Then on the actions or payloads it performs once a target is reached.

**Also classified by:**
Those that need a host program (parasitic code such as viruses).
Those that are independent, self-contained programs (worms, trojans, and bots).
Malware that does not replicate (trojans and spam e-mail).
Malware that does replicate (viruses and worms).
### Types of Malicious Software (Malware)

*Propagation mechanisms include:*

- Infection of existing content by viruses that is subsequently spread to other systems.
- Exploit of software vulnerabilities by worms or drive-by-downloads to allow the malware to replicate
- Social engineering attacks that convince users to bypass security mechanisms to install. Trojans or to respond to phishing attacks.

*Payload actions performed by malware once it reaches a target system can include:*
- Corruption of system or data files
- Theft of service/make the system a zombie agent of attack as part of a botnet
- Theft of information from the system/keylogging
- Stealthing/hiding its presence on the system

### Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)

Well-resourced, persistent application of a wide variety of intrusion technologies and
malware to selected targets (usually business or political)
-  Typically attributed to state-sponsored organizations and criminal enterprises
- Differ from other types of attack by their careful target selection and stealthy intrusion efforts over extended periods
- High profile attacks include Aurora, RSA, APT1, and Stuxnet

### APT Characteristics
>[!note] Advanced
>Used by attackers of a wide variety of intrusion technologies and malware including the develpoment of custom malware if required. The individual components may not necessarily be technically advanced but are carefully selected to suit the chosen target.

>[!note] Persistent
>Determined application of attacks over an extended period against the chosen target in order to maximize the chance of success. A variety of attacks may be progressively applied until the target is compromised.

>[!note] Threats
>Threats to the selected targets as a result of the organized, capable and well funded attackers intent to compromise the specificaly chosen targets. The active involvement of people in the process greatly raises the threat level from that due to automated attack tools and also the lilelihood of successful attacks

#### ATP Attacks
**Aim**: 
- Varies from theft of intellectual property or security and infrastructure related data to the physical distruption of infrastructure
**Technique used:**
- social engineering
- spear-phishing email
- drive-by-downlads from selected compromised websites likely to be visted by personnel in the target organization
**Intent:**
- To infect the target with sophisticated malware with multiple propagation mechanism and payloads
- Once they have gained initial access to systems  in the target organization a further rnage of attack tools are used to amintain and extend their access
## Viruses
Piece of software that infects programs, modifes them to include a copy of the virus, replicates and goes om to infect other content, easily spread through network environments.
It can do everything that the program infected is permitted to, it executes secretly when the host program is run.
